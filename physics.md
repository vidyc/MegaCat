Basics:
Game runs at 60frames/s
Horizontal speed 1.375px/frame there is instant acceleration and only deceleration on ice (not sure what the decel rate is, haven't programmed ice yet)
jumping his vertical speed is set to 4.75px/frame (in mm4 and up, slightly different in mm1 and mm2)
gravity is 0.25px/frame (subtract 0.25 from vertical speed each frame not on ground)
if fall speed is faster than 7px/frame cap it at 7 (this number is 12 in mm1 and 2)
collision on ceiling is only checked when moving up and floor when moving down.
when MM's next frame would put him in the floor he is instead adjusted down to the pixel before contact with the floor.
